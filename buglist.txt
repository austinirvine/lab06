------------------BUGLIST-------------------------------------------

1. isEmpty - (Always returns true)

2. addBack - does not add to the back of the List

3. removeFront - does not change the list that I know of
    *no size Change
    *vector is unchanged
    *Returns False even when list is not empty

4. removeBack - does not change the list either
    *size doesn't Change
    *vector is the same
    *Returns False even when list is not empty

Conclusion -> I think most of the issues are caused by
the isEmpty() method, although there are likely more issues.
